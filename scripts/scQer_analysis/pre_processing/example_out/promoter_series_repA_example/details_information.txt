These are example intermediate files for attempting to process the mBC and oBC data that can be found here: 

oBC: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/?view=run_browser&acc=SRR22253236&display=data-access
mBC: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/?view=run_browser&acc=SRR22253239&display=data-access

These are the input fastqs that can be run through respectively the oBC_scQer_preprocessing.sh and mBC_scQEr_preprocessing.sh bash scripts (after adjustments). 

Example intermediate outputs are included here (for the oBC). 

After processing of the cellRanger bam file for barcodes, but prior to UMI pile up and error correction, the file should look like:
head_repA_scQer_oBC_get_bc_v3_20220201.txt.gz

After UMI pile up and error correction, the file shoud look like: 
head_repA_scQer_oBC_get_bc_v3_no_G_cleaned_UMI_20220201.txt.gz
